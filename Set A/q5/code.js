 * @param {number} number - The number
 * @returns {string | number} - "foo" if number is divisible by 3, "bar" if number is divisible by 5, "foobar" if number is divisible by both 3 and 5, otherwise return the number.
 *
 * Basic: Do it with if-else
 * Challenge: Do it only with AND, OR, and modulus operator. (Hint: Short circuiting)

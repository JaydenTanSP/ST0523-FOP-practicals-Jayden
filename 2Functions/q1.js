/**
 * Recall from Operator Q4.4:
 *
 * 4 - What about a boolean expression?
 *    e.g. Is your L1R4 score eligible for a desired course?
 *    What values are involved? The score of each subject? The L1R4? The cut-off?
 *      And lastly whether you are eligible.
 *    Give each of the values a meaningful name and combine them together to determine if you are eligible.
 *      Store any intermediate results in appropriately named variables.
 *
 * Write a function that takes in the score of each subject and the cut-off score for a desired course.
 * The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the student is eligible for the desired course.
 *
 * Run the code using `node q1.js`

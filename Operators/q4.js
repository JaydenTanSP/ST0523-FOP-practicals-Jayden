/**
 * 1- Let's calculate the area of a rectangle
 *       for e.g. 6 * 5 is not very descriptive
 *       Let's first give 6 and 5 some names by storing them in appropriately named variables
 *       Store the result in a variable with an appropriate name.
 */

// 2 - How about area of a circle? What values are involved? What names would you give each value?

/**
 * 3 - What about putting together a string?
 *     e.g. Your home address is made up of multiple parts like
 *      1. Block number
 *      2. Unit number
 *      3. Street name
 *      4. Postal code
 *
 * Give each part a meaningful name and combine them together to form your full address.
 */

/**
 * 4 - What about a boolean expression?
 *    e.g. Is your L1R4 score eligible for a desired course?
 *    What values are involved? The score of each subject? The L1R4? The cut-off?
 *      And lastly whether you are eligible.
 *    Give each of the values a meaningful name and combine them together to determine if you are eligible.
 *      Store any intermediate results in appropriately named variables.

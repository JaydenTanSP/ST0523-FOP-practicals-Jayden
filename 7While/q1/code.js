/**
 * Youâ€™ve previously learned about the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones:
 *
 * 1st Fibonacci number = 0
 * 2nd Fibonacci number = 1
 * 3rd Fibonacci number = 0 + 1 = 1
 * 4th Fibonacci number = 1 + 1 = 2
 * 5th Fibonacci number = 1 + 2 = 3
 * 6th Fibonacci number = 2 + 3 = 5
 * 7th Fibonacci number = 3 + 5 = 8
 * ...and so on.
 *
 * In this task, you're given a partially completed function that you need to fix.
 * The function should determine the *position* of a given number `k` in the Fibonacci sequence.
 *
 * For example:
 *   - If the input is 5, the function should return 6 (since 5 is the 6th Fibonacci number).
 *   - If the input is 8, the function should return 7.
 *
 * @param {number} k - A valid Fibonacci number (starting from the 3rd Fibonacci number onwards)
 * @return {number} The position of `k` in the Fibonacci sequence
